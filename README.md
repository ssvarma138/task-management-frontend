# Task Management Frontend

Hey there! This is my college project for a simple task management app. It's built with Next.js and TypeScript.

## What it does

- Shows a list of tasks
- Lets you add new tasks
- You can update task status
- Delete tasks you don't need anymore

## Tech stuff I used

- Next.js
- TypeScript
- Axios for talking to the backend
- Just plain CSS for now (nothing fancy)

## How to run it

1. Clone this repo
2. Run `npm install` to get all the dependencies
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the app
4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

## What I want to add later

- User login (so you can have your own tasks)
- Make it look prettier
- Maybe add categories for tasks

## Notes

This is just a basic version for my personal project. It's not perfect, but it works!
